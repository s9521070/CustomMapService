## How to use
- install LimeSurvey 
- copy CustomMapService folder to LimeSurvey plugins folder
- go to LimeSurvey admin panel -> configuration -> plugin manager
- configure this plugin to use the XYZ url of your running openmaptiles instance
- enable plugin

## How it works?
It simply replaces the existing Google Maps or OSM initialization. Note that during question creation you wil still be shown these two options, but both options will be overridden when this plugin is enabled.
